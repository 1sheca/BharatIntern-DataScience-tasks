# Data Science Internship Readme

Welcome to the readme for my Data Science internship experience! This document outlines the tasks and projects I have worked on during my internship, highlighting my contributions and the skills I have gained. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out to me.

## Overview

During my internship, I had the privilege to work on three diverse and challenging projects in the field of Data Science. These projects include:

1. Stock Prediction
2. Titanic Classification
3. Number Recognition

Below, I provide a brief overview of each project along with the methodologies, tools, and skills I utilized to complete them.

## 1. Stock Prediction

### Overview

In this project, I focused on utilizing historical stock market data to build predictive models for stock price movements. The primary goal was to create a reliable forecasting model to assist in making informed investment decisions.

### Methodology

I employed time series analysis techniques to preprocess and analyze the historical stock data. I utilized machine learning algorithms, including ARIMA and LSTM, to build and evaluate predictive models. Feature engineering, data normalization, and hyperparameter tuning were crucial steps in enhancing the model's performance.

### Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- TensorFlow for building and training LSTM models
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and documentation

## 2. Titanic Classification

### Overview

The Titanic classification project aimed to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on a set of features. The objective was to demonstrate proficiency in classification algorithms and model evaluation.

### Methodology

I started by performing exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and identify potential features for classification. I then implemented various classification algorithms, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. Model performance was assessed through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for coding and analysis
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for visualizing insights

## 3. Number Recognition

### Overview

The number recognition project involved creating a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. This project aimed to showcase my skills in image processing and classification.

### Methodology

I utilized the MNIST dataset containing thousands of handwritten digit images. I preprocessed the images, applied techniques such as image augmentation and normalization, and implemented classification models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate digit recognition.

### Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook for coding and experimentation
- Image processing libraries (OpenCV) for data preprocessing

## Key Takeaways

Throughout these projects, I honed my skills in:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- Time series analysis for stock prediction
- Image processing for number recognition

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on these projects, and I look forward to applying the knowledge and experience gained from this internship to future data science endeavors.

If you have any further questions or would like to discuss any aspect of my internship experience, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for the valuable learning experience.

Sincerely

The Stock Prediction project involved leveraging historical stock market data to develop predictive models for stock price movements. Through the utilization of time series analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms like ARIMA and LSTM were employed to forecast stock prices. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning were crucial for enhancing model accuracy. Python, along with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, was used for coding and modeling. The project aimed to provide insights into potential investment decisions by predicting future stock price trends based on past data patterns.
